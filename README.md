# AWS CDK TypeScript Template

This repo is a basic template for creating an AWS CDK app with TypeScript. It builds off of the general patterns used in [aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples), serving as a space for my own personal preferences and experimentation. ⚙️🧪💣

## Setup

See [the docs](./docs/devcontainer.md) for instructions on setting up a development container with VS Code.
